I will be deploying and configuring a nginx webserver. I will be using Azure to do this first project, if you are wish to do so and you have a student email you can get free 100 credits and try it out. I have used NGINX to serve the HTML
So now when anyone visits 102.37.144.137

Receives the HTTP request from the browser

Looks into /var/www/html/ for a file named index.html

Finds your custom page

Sends that HTML content back as the browser response
